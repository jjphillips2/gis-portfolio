# About Me
I am a second year Public Policy and Management - Data Analytics student who hopes to continue his career as a Data Scientist post graduation. My current work is in the retail space but I hope to enter into a career in either Transportation or Education. As a former high school teacher, I would love to find where the highest areas of need our in our education system and use data to create informed solutions.

I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Alabama. I then moved to New York City to teach high school math for three years. After leaving teaching, I found myself back in the classroom, but again as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. In May of 2023, I plan to finish my master's degree and will hopefully go on to become a Data Scientist in either the education or transportation sector. 

# What I Hope to Learn
I hope to be able to use GIS techniques to tell clearer stories with the data I am presented. I am also interested in creating project bids as this will become useful in any career I may take on. I also hope to learn ways to make maps more engaging and interactive. In my current role, I struggle to find new and creative ways to represent both structured and unstructured data. I hope this course will introduce new perspectives on how to think of which visuals are most appropriate.
